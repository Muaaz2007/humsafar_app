 HUMSAFAR 

> *Drop your complaint. We do the chasing.*

HUMSAFAR is an AI-powered platform that simplifies public issue reporting. With just a photo, voice or text, and location, anyone can submit a complaint — and HUMSAFAR takes care of the rest. Built using IBM Granite models, it understands, summarizes, prioritizes, and routes complaints to the right department. No forms. No confusion. Just action.
